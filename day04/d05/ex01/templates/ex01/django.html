<p><br>
Django is a free, open-source Python framework released in 2005 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison.
Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. 
The framework emphasizes reusability and pluggability of components, less code, loose coupling, rapid development, and the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.
